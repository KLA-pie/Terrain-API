# Backyard-Gardening-API

This repository is for Experiment 3 & 4 in AHSE 1515 Products and Markets

As people become more environmentally aware, people will generally want to try and change their practices such as better conservation practices, switching to sustainable technologies, and composting. One of these practices include gardening. However, people may find it difficult to be able to grow their own crops for a multitude of reasons with one of the primary reasons being that there is not enough information to intake about which crops are the best to cultivate. The purpose of this repository is to help deduce conditions where specific crops are best for growing.
